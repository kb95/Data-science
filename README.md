Data science - Powerful as a black hole
How more people die in Africa from contagious disease than from America?
How apple become the most successful tech company and the most valuable on the planet earth?
Why West considers China a bigger threat than Russia?
How can a country claim to become carbon neutral by 2050?
The answers to the above questions somewhere lies in the data , more accurate the data more precise our answer becomes. When a large chunk of data is gathered and then converted into a precise and legitimate form and then extraction of the most practical data and presenting it by visuals such as charts to the stakeholders and explaining the extract in the most efficient manner just like JK Rowling novel is what we call a data scientist .
Data science is nothing but making the past data into work to extract fruitful results in the future. It is said that a large incident is the outcome of many small spontaneous incidents happened in the past, for example you had a heart attack not because you were having a bad day but the bad cholesterol have been accumulating in the arteries over the period of time and giving you symptoms like shortness of breath , chest pain etc but you ignored them. Data is what accumulating in todays world over the cloud which we call the Big data and joining the dots and producing meaningful conclusion from that data is what data science is.
