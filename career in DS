My opnions:
We can have many options as career in DS.
Data science have vast implementations according to me few of them would be:
# Working for the intelligence department for a country where we can extract data about the past incidents like bomb blast , mass shootings , murders other terror activities and help to find the reason for the incidents, people who are associated belong to a particular region or ethnicity or some common trait , locations where such incidents are most likely to happen.
#Working with institutes like NASA by examine the  data such as energy wave and start pattern and finding the similarities between other planet and earth we could find another habitable planet.
# Working for a financial institute to examine the stats of money inflow and goods produced , purchasing power and evolution of newer technologies and their impact on business and hence conclude future growth predictions for a organisation or country as a whole.
